<h3>Use JavaScript on the front-end and Java for code behind</h3>
<h5>Why would i use HTML, CSS and JavaScript anyway ? If i there are frameworks like Swing, AWT, JavaFX etc</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Provide a complete separation of front-end and code-behind</li>
  <li>HTML, JavaScript and CSS helps you build interactive UI/UX reletively easily and quiclky</li>
  <li>It is not very feasible to access native APIs using JavaScript. (Java can save the day)</li>
</ul>

<h5>Why won't i use NodeJS if it were about building UIs using JS ? Isn't C++ add ons more than enough to give that extra bit of super power ?</h5>
<ul>
  <li>UI framworks running on NodeJS usually build a bulky app.</li>
  <li>C++ / C is tad bit trickier than Java. Isn't it ?</li>
  <li>Java is battle tested, whereas nothing compares to JavaScript for building UIs</li>
</ul>

<h5>How does it work anyway ?</h5>
<p>The idea is simple
<br/>
Spin up a localhost that acts as the middleware bettween the HTML, JS, CSS pages and the code behind (using Java)
<br/></p>

<h5>Do i have to write all the JS and CSS to build that fancy GUI ?</h5>
<p><b>No</b> Bootstrap CDN and Jquery copied on the local file saves a lot of time and helps build good looking and interactive GUIs</p>
